## :wave: Hello!

### What i learned about github:
I have a good felling with how  _basic git_ works and the **`git pull` "change" `git add` `git commit` `git push` workflow**.
It took me a bit to understand **branches** and **pull-requests** but I think I'm [x] getting it now.
As I have never worked with latex or an code-based-text-editing program before, I found this really cool to try out! :ðŸ˜Ž:
