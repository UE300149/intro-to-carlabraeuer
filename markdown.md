## :wave: Hello!

### What I learned about github:
I have a good felling with how  _basic git_ works and the `git pull` **"change"** `git add` `git commit` `git push` workflow.
It took me a bit to understand **branches** and **pull-requests** but I think I'm getting it now.
As I have never worked with LaTeX or an code-based-text-editing program before, I found this really cool to try out! ðŸ˜Ž
